## Introduction

<!-- Setting up the problem -->
New York City is one of the most popular financial hubs for investors and businessmen to travel, where Airbnb can be a place of choices to choose while they are travelling, and the accommodation owners like to rent their rooms while they are not using it yet. Now we know that Airbnb collects data about how their service is used. As Airbnb itself is a popular option for travellers, so we (investors, stakeholders, etc.) can expect to learn some of the customer behaviors from this data.

<!-- Why it's important such that the project should be done. -->
What if we could find a way to benefit from Airbnb's listing data for New York City? Are there some relationships among the venues around the rentals that impact the guests' decisions? What could we learn more from this?
